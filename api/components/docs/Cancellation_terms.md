# Cancellation Terms - 01A

## Overview
Cancellation terms allow the **Logistics Service Provider (LSP)** to define rules for order cancellations during the pre-order flow. These rules apply to cancellations initiated by both the **LSP and the LBNP (Logistics Buyer Network Participant)**. The terms outline cancellation fees, fulfillment states, and reason codes.

## Key Features
- **Fulfillment-Based Cancellations**: Terms are defined at the fulfillment level.
- **Cancellation Fees**: Charges are applied based on the orderâ€™s fulfillment state.
- **NACK Option**: If terms are unacceptable, LBNP can NACK `/on_init` or `/on_confirm` with error code `62505`.
- **Aggregate Fees**: Total cancellation fees for an order are the sum of all individual fulfillment cancellation fees.
- **Transparent Pricing**: Actual cancellation fees appear in the order quote after fulfillment or order cancellation.
